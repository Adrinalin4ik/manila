//! The window's size in device pixels, for `gxResolution`.
//!
//! On the reference client `gxResolution` is the mode the game draws at, and pfUI derives the
//! size of one device pixel from it (`768 / height / uiScale`) for its borders. The host keeps
//! that CVar for the windowed size only and draws fullscreen at the monitor's own, so the stored
//! string is not what is on screen: pfUI's borders came out two pixels thick on a 1800-line
//! display. With the extension, `GetCVar("gxResolution")` answers what the window really is.
